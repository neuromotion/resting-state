## Overview

This repo contains the Resting State task. It is a [jspsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) task built with React and Electron. This task uses [Honeycomb](https://brown-ccv.github.io/honeycomb-docs/).

The task involves several relaxed tasks: following a moving dot with one's eyes, responding to beeps, and fixating on a dot.
